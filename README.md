# The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors

First solo project I had to make as part of the JavaScript part of the Odin Project curriculum.

VERSION 1:

  • Console based application
  • Press F12 when entering the website and click on the console section to see the game updating
  • The game doesn't have a way of handling null inputs (Yet)
